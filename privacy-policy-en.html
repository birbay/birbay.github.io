        </p>

        <h2>IV. HOW LONG WE KEEP AND USE YOUR DATA</h2>

        <p>
            We will keep your personal information only as long as necessary to provide the functional service of the application and

        </p>

        <h2>V. SHARING OF DATA</h2>

        <p>
            When we integrate external services, we carefully select third-party providers who implement appropriate technical and

            and device identifiers from tools with third-party organizations.
        </p>

        <p>
            To provide the necessary infrastructure for the delivery and improvement of our services, we may use the following

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Firebase / Google LLC (USA)</td>
                <td>Authentication, analytics and marketing service provider. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></td>
            </tr>

        </table>

        <h2>VI. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2>

        <h3>Location Data Processing</h3>
        <p>
            On your iOS device, go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Select the relevant application and set the

        </p>

        </p>

        <h2>IX. DATA SECURITY</h2>

        <p>
            We take the security of your personal information seriously and have implemented measures to protect it from loss, 
            misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We follow industry-standard practices to 
            protect personal information submitted to us during transmission.
        </p>

        <p>
            To safeguard your personal information, we implement technical and organizational measures that align with data protection 
            principles. We use encryption algorithms to secure your personal data.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we take 
            appropriate measures to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the event of a security breach that compromises your personal information, we will notify you promptly as required by law.
